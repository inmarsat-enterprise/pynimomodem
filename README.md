# pynimomodem

A Python implementation of the Viasat NIMO modem interface for satellite IoT.

NIMO stands for **N**on-**I**P **M**odem **O**RBCOMM and represents a family
of low cost satellite data modems that use network protocols developed by
[ORBCOMM](www.orbcomm.com) including IsatData Pro (IDP) and OGx.

These ORBCOMM protocols can operate over the Viasat L-band global network in
cooperation with a varietry of authorized Viasat IoT service partners, and
are intended for event-based remote data collection and device control.

Example NIMO modems available:
* [ORBCOMM ST2100](https://www.orbcomm.com/en/partners/iot-hardware/st-2100)
* [Quectel CC200A-LB](https://www.quectel.com/product/cc200a-lb-satellite-communication-module)
